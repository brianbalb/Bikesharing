[Table Public Dashboard] (https://public.tableau.com/views/AugustRiderBreakdownbyGender/Dashboard1?:language=en-US&publish=yes&:display_count=n&:origin=viz_share_link)

## Overview of the statistical analysis:

*In this project, I was requested to create a visual business proposal using Tableau Public.*

Data on Citi bike ridership in New York City is analyzed to determine the business prospects of creating a similar business in Des Moines, Iowa. 

The Pandas DataFrames and Tableau Calculated Fields are used to transform the datatypes and format of some columns.


## Results:

1. The analysis begins with general information, which contains a map of the top starting locations for rides in NYC and a pie chart showing the gender distribution of riders. This dashboard is intended to provide a basic overview of the data.

2. Total user checkout times are then shown, which is then followed by the same graph filtered by gender. This line graph showcased the large disparity in Male and Female ridership.

3. Total trips by weekday are visualized as a heatmap. The majority of Monday-Friday trips are 7 AM - 9 AM and 5 PM - 7 PM. When filtering this heatmap by Gender, it is again found that Male ridership far outpaces Female ridership. However, the peak riding hours across all genders are similar.

4 User trips by gender is visualized, this chart illustrates that users are much more likely to be subscribers, rather than ordinary customers.

## Summary:

In this analysis, the majority of Citi bike riders in New York City (NYC) identify as Male. 

Additionally, these rides typically begin in Ubran and densely populated areas. 
* Bike riding may be an attractive alternative to cars in NYC
* Congested streets attract more riders
* the ease of transportation is why they would choose not to ride

# Suggestions

Although this business is popular in NYC due to the heavy traffic, it is not certain that Des Moines will develop the same success. However the data has given us clear perspective, into our current cusomter and user base, current status. 

The insight allows the confirmation that more research on Des Moines must be conducted to determine whether car traffic and locational convenience would motivate potential customers to use this service, as our data shows these are our customers most attractive attributes. 

**CAUTION TO KEEP IN MIND
While NYC has a population density of approximately 27,000 people per square mile, Des Moines only has 2,436 people per square mile. In fact, NYC has nearly 39 times the population of Des Moines.**
